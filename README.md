# sustainable-hecap

The website `sustainable-hecap` is an initiative by a volunteer network of scientists in the fields of High Energy Physics, Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics (HECAP) who are concerned about the climate crisis and advocating for a transition towards a sustainable academia.

The online platform `sustainable-hecap` is the point of contact for HECAP scientists willing to learn, join the conversation or take actions towards more sustainability in HECAP.

## History
Following the workshop "Sustainable HEP" ([indico event](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1004432/)) in June 2021, several HECAP members started a reflexion culminating in a White Paper. This document represents a community-wide step towards identifying these impacts, proposing positive changes that individuals, groups and institutions can make, and highlighting the associated opportunities for improving social justice.

## Status
The White/Green Paper/Reflection Document that many participants have worked hard on is already available on the website, and is nearing first public draft status to be released on the Arxiv, likely to be submitted in mid-2023 there.
